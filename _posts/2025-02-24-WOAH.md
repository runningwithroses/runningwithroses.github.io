## Bleach
I almost passed out twice today. First was when I was coming back from my music theory class. I noticed that I was getting farther away from the sidewalk as I was walking, and found my knees buckling almost throwing me into the ground.
Then when I was in Alyssa's class I felt my head getting heavier, and before I knew it my desk was rapidly approaching my face. My nose still hurts. So I decided not to go to my final class for the day.

Instead of going to class, I helped my friend make cut-outs for her political science course. She's trying to memorise all of the ammendments to the constitution, as well as  the Bill of Rights.
We also gossiped about rumours from other colleges and about other students.

I went to orchestra practice for the first time in weeks. I haven't practiced any of the music at all and I am still the best-sounding musician there. I wish this wasn't the case.
Sometimes I regret not going to UMKC or Madison. My life could've been entirely different. I would've been a whole new person. Probably one without the problems I have now.

I also bleached my hair tonight with some friends. We completely forgot that we dyed my hair red last term, so when we bleached it my hair came out pink!
None of us were expecting it, now I have two strands in my middle part that are bleached blonde at the root with gradient red tips. It looks like my hair is on fire!
I think I like it.

We're all beginning to get burnt out. Hopefully this weekend will save me!
