## Nighttime Talks.

I like nighttime talks with my friends. One of my friends was feeling really sick, so me and two others went over there to make sure they were alright.
While I was at their apartment I had a conversation with one of the others. We talked about biker gangs and gossiped a little bit!

In all honesty, I'm a little scared. Rumour is that ICE is out and about in the area. I was born here, so I have nothing to fear, but the thought that men with guns will be walking around town frightens me.
I don't want to go to class and be stopped by a man in a heavy silk vest and a large submachine gun.

I don't want to be stopped and have to open up my case in the cold and show them my violin,
I don't want to be violated on my way to class and have men look at me like I am dangerous.

Like I'm a criminal.

I had a nighttime talk about this with my friends. They're afraid too. But they have nothing to worry about.
My Dad wasn't born here.

He gained his citizenship as a teenager.
So much so he denounced his Indian citizenship.

He wanted to be a true American.
I didn't know there was such a thing.

I'm a little scared that they'll pick me up and throw me in a room without question.
Just because my skin stands out in the snow.

I'm a little scared that I won't be able to have these nighttime talks while my friend's dog sheds her hair all over my coat.
Hair that takes an hour to pick out with a lint roller.

She does it to protect me.
