##January 6 2024 | Old Entry
I found this old journal entry! I think I'll be including these every now and again just to see how much I've grown!
```tsql
It's been a little while. Today was Eddie's Birthday. Classes seem easy enough, Drawing 100 looks like it's going to be your hardest. After PSYCH you went to the Art Building to play piano. You felt a moment of serene and blissful silence. A little feeling of God. You offered to help Elizabeth take her bags to the shareshop, but they were closed, so you're going back with her tomorrow. You played Cards against Humanity with Austin and Aiden and a few people from Post. After that, Shilo went through the scripts of the plays this term while you sorted Ella's cards for him. After that, Eddie joined the conversation and brought up a weird talking point, what animals you can ethically fuck. I still think none of them is the correct answer. I've missed it here.
