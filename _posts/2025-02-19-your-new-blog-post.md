## Post One

Hello! Before I begin, I'd like to point something out. One of the reasons I started this blog is because I suffer from memory loss issues.
I want to be able to look back on my college years, look at these posts, and remember college fondly! I don't want to forget some of the most important years of my life!

While I make posts I'll also be learning a little bit on how to code, and I'll add my art and music on here as well. 
Maybe I'll print out some of my posts and make mixed media stuff, who knows!

I hope to have fun exploring this little world I'm in, and to make something of it! To run in a field of roses!
